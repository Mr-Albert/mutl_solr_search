Project statement :
 Now we need to build a user friendly web site, which will navigate throw one Solr schema.
         This site will view the data in tabular way(Column for each field).
         We need to give the user the flexibility to search and sort using any field in very smart way.
 
         Note1: Fields are in many types( Integer, Float, string, text, date â€¦..)
         Note2: viewing and column order should be from temples files which we can save in DB in the future.
         Note3: try to find a good JQuery grid  or any alternative tool.
